🚴 Project Overview

BikeAppAppp is a .NET-based application designed to manage and interact with bike-related data. The solution is structured into multiple projects, each serving a specific purpose, ensuring modularity and maintainability.


🗂 Project Structure

The solution comprises the following projects:

  BikeAppApp.Api: The API layer responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.

  BikeAppApp: The core application logic and services.

  BikeAppApp.Shared.Dtos: Contains Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) shared across different layers of the application.

  BikeAppApp.Tests: Unit and integration tests to ensure the application's functionality and reliability.


🔧 Technologies Used

  C#: The primary programming language for backend development.

  ASP.NET Core: Framework for building the API layer.

  Entity Framework Core: ORM for database interactions.

  xUnit: Testing framework used for unit and integration tests.

  CSS/HTML: For any frontend components or views.
